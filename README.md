## 👋 Hey, I’m Alina Slipenka

# Junior Full-Stack Developer | JavaScript • React • Node.js

---

I enjoy the moment when an idea turns into something real, clickable, and useful.
I focus on clean structure, readable code, and interfaces that make sense to users — not just to developers.

I’ve worked on both team-based and personal projects, taken on roles like Team Lead and Scrum Master, and feel comfortable owning features from idea to delivery. I learn fast, adapt quickly, and care about building things that scale without becoming messy.
