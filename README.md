👋 Hi, I’m Alina Slipenka
A bit about me

Junior Full-Stack Developer who genuinely enjoys turning ideas into working products.
I work mostly with JavaScript, React, and Node.js, care about clean structure, readable code, and interfaces that make sense to real users. I’ve worked on both team and personal projects, know how Agile teams function, and I’m not afraid to take responsibility when something needs to be done (or fixed).

I learn fast, ask questions when it matters, and prefer solutions that are simple, scalable, and maintainable — even if they take a bit longer to think through.
